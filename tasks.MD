1. Uncomment the "Download CV" button on lines 67-74 in Hero.tsx, and change the text to "Preview CV".
- Upon clicking this, a new temporary pop up should open up, and the background (the website) should blur.
- This popup should render a pdf file (to which I will supply a cloudfront link).
- The popup should come up (and close) with a smooth ios style animation.
- The popup should be scrollable, and clicking anywhere outside should dismiss it (add a X button on the top right too).
- The cloudfront URL for the pdf file should be a config which I can set somewhere.
